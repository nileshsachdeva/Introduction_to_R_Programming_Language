# Penguin Plots: Practice Analysis

## Setting up my environment
Notes: Setting up my R environment by loading the `tidyverse` and `palmerpenguins` packages

``{r loading packages}
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("palmerpenguins")
``

Rendering a file also automatically runs the code chunks to show the output. In this example, it shows that tidyverse was loaded using the `library()` function.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(palmerpenguins)
```
